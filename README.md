Script works with Google News API. 

It takes topics listed in a variable 'topics' and looks through the news sources listed in a variable 'sources'.

Only today's news from 4am UTC time is returned as a result in a format:
1. Description
2. Url

The result is stored in a variable 'body', that could be sent by email.
